Lab10 feedback for Gavars Mitch (mag051)
------------------------------------------------------------
prelab: bit operations: Exercise 1-4: Function implemented in C. Logic is correct and only used
allowed operators.
	Score: 20 / 20
prelab: float min and max: Exercise 5: Clear derivation for both single and double precision floating
point min and max positive numbers.
	Score: 3 / 5
	Comment: For Single Precision?
All zero mantissa is reserved

Exercise 1: Modified floats.s to define the correct values for ohs and ohd.
	Score: 10 / 10
Exercise 2: inspect_float and inspect_double work correctly which include values of 0.5,
0.75, 0.875, and 0.8125. Implemented f2u and u2f in floats.s.
	Score: 15 / 25
	floats.c/s don't compile, same fore below
Exercise 3: precision implemented. Comments have the correct value for the next float
after 1.0. Comments discuss how precision changes for large/small numbers.
	Score: 15 / 25
Exercise 4: sum added with comments describing why it doesnâ€™t work as it. Implemented the
is_near function and modified sum to use it with an appropriate epsilon.
